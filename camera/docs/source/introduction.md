# Introduction

Welcome to the Developer Guide for the SLN-TLHMI-IOT!

The purpose of this guide is to help developers gain a better understanding of the software design and architecture of the applications in order to more easily and efficiently implement applications using the SLN-TLHMI-IOT.

This guide will cover topics including the bootloader and the framework + HAL architecture design, as well as other features which may be relevant to the development of applications using the SLN-TLHMI-IOT.

If you haven't already, be sure to check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/NXP/sln_tlhmi_iot) for an overview of the out of box features available in the SLN-TLHMI-IOT applications.
