# Introduction

This project contains all the source code for [NXP's Smart HMI solution](www.nxp.com/mcu-smhmi).
For information about getting up and running with the Smart HMI solution, check out the [Smart HMI Getting Started Guide].

## Out-of-Box Demos

The Smart HMI Solution comes with a few different demo applications flashed right out of the box.
These applications include the [Coffee Machine](#coffee-machine), [Elevator](#elevator), and [Smart Panel](#smart-panel) demo applications,
with new functionality and demos being added in as part of update releases.

Each of these apps are intended to demonstrate and highlight different functionality that the solution supports,
while providing a software reference design and boilerplate code to accelerate development of your own applications.

#### Source Code

By default, the firmware for the Smart Panel application is located at `0x32900000`, while the resource files (images, audio files, etc.) are located at `0x33000000`.

## Bootloader

The Smart HMI solution utilizes a multi-stage boot process to enable additional security features, update mechanisms, and more.
As part of this multi-stage boot process, the out-of-box firmware uses a bootloader project which is responsible for,
among other things,

- Selecting which application to run based on the button held during boot
- Enabling [Mass Storage Device (MSD) Drag-and-Drop](#mass-storage-device-msd-drag-and-drop-updates) updates

The source code for the bootloader application can be found under the `bootloader` folder.
By default, the firmware for the bootloader project is located at `0x30000000`.

Additional details regarding the bootloader and the features it supports can be found in the [Smart HMI Software Developer Guide].

## Framework

The Smart HMI Solution makes use of NXP's "Framework Architecture" which is designed to accelerate development by:

- Reducing the amount of tightly coupled code that exists in each of the projects
- Allow for code reuse among different projects and platforms by making use of a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Enabling easier communication between cores in multi-core projects

More details regarding the Framework architecture, including its design and usage, can be found in the [Smart HMI Software Developer Guide].

## Installing Updates

For each new [release](https://github.com/NXP/mcu-smhmi/releases), pre-built binaries for each of the out-of-box demo applications (Coffee Machine, Elevator, etc.) are provided so that you can quickly flash these updates to your board and test out the changes.
To test these new releases, the Smart HMI supports a few different mechanisms to quickly and easily update your firmware.
This includes updating via:

- [Mass Storage Device (MSD) Drag-and-Drop](#mass-storage-device-msd-drag-and-drop-updates)
- [J-Link](#j-link-updates)

### Mass Storage Device (MSD) Drag-and-Drop Updates

> **Note**
> This feature currently only supports Windows devices.

While many developers may have access to debug probes like the Segger J-Link which they can use to flash new updates,
many other stakeholders may not have access to these kinds of tools.
In order to enable those users to test and run the latest updates,
the Smart HMI solution supports the ability to update the kit using a drag-and-drop mechanism which allows flashing updates in a manner similar to how you copy files to a USB flash drive.

To perform an MSD update, the kit must first be put into "MSD mode" by pressing and holding the `SW0` push button on the back of the kit while the kit is being powered on. Success will be indicated by a pulsing purple light on the front of the kit.

![MSD Enabled](./docs/source/img/bootloader/msd_enabled.gif)

Once MSD mode is enabled, in addition to the purple light on the front of the kit, your PC will display a new USB Drive device which can be found in File Explorer like any regular USB Drive device.

![USB Drive in File Explorer](docs/source/img/bootloader/bootloader_MSD_FileExplorer.png)

Now, to update the firmware on the device, simply copy the binary file for each demo app you want to update over to the USB Drive associated with your kit.

> **Note**
> Using the MSD feature to perform an update may change the buttons associated with the Coffee Machine, Elevator, and Smart Panel apps.
> For more info as to why this is the case, check out the MSD section in the [Smart HMI Software Developer Guide].

While a firmware update is in progress, a dialog window will appear which is identical to what you might see when copying a large set of files from a folder on your PC to a folder on a USB drive.
Because of the size of these updates and the time it takes to erase and write to the flash,
this process may take several minutes.

![MSD Update in Progress](./docs/source/img/bootloader/msd_update_in_progress.png)

Once completed, the board will automatically reset itself and begin running the newly updated application.

At this point, the same process can be repeated for any additional updates you would like to test.

> **Note**
> MSD Drag-and-Drop updates only work for "application" binaries (Coffee Machine, Elevator, etc.), but not the bootloader.
> More information can be found in the "Application Banks" section of the [Smart HMI Software Developer Guide].
> For instructions to flash "non-application" binaries like the bootloader, see [J-Link](#j-link-updates).

For a more in-depth look at the MSD Drag-and-Drop feature, check out the "Mass Storage Device Updates" section of the [Smart HMI Software Developer Guide].

### J-Link Updates

For developers interested in having more control over how firmware updates are handled, a J-Link Debug Probe can be used to flash updates via the JTAG port found on the back of the kit (`J204`).

Assuming you have access to a J-Link debug probe,
one option for flashing updates is to use the **"J-Flash"** application found in Segger's [J-Link Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/).

To use J-Flash to update your kit, perform the following steps:

1. Power your Smart HMI kit using the onboard USB-C port
2. Connect the USB cable from your J-Link debug probe to your PC
3. Connect the J-Link 9-Pin Cortex-M adapter cable to the `J204` **"RT JTAG"** port on the back of your kit.
4. Open the J-Flash application.
5. Select **"Create New Project"** and click **"Start J-Flash"**
6. Select **"SWD"** as the target interface.
7. Select **"MIMXRT1176xxxA_M7"** as the target device.
8. (Optional) Configure the speed of the probe.
9. Click **"OK"**
10. Drag-and-drop the firmware image you want to flash
    - Make sure to use the flash address corresponding to the application you are flashing (bootloader, Coffee Machine, Elevator, etc.)
11. Select **"Target->Manual Programming->Program and Verify"**

If successful, you should receive a message like the following:
